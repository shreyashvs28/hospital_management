                <h2>About Blood-Drop</h2>
                <p>Blood-Drop is a platform to provide information about blood banks, blood availability, blood donation camps, and donation assistance automation. Over 1000 blood centers are registered on Blood-Drop across multiple states.</p>
                <p>Blood-Drop is a modern web-based blood donation platform connecting donors and recipients efficiently, ensuring timely and safe blood distribution. It tracks donor health, donation history, and blood component availability. The platform
                    enables blood banks and hospitals to manage inventory, organize donation camps, and send alerts to registered donors. It is scalable and customizable for nationwide stakeholders. Donating blood involves a simple, multi-step process
                    including registration, a mini-physical to check vital signs and hemoglobin, and the actual collection of blood, which takes a short amount of time but the entire process lasts about an hour. You must meet specific health requirements,
                    such as being between 18 and 65 years old, having a minimum weight (e.g., 45 kg), and being generally healthy. The donated blood can be used to save lives for various medical needs and is thoroughly screened for diseases before use.</p>
                <h3>Eligibility to Donate Blood</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age: Be at least 18 years old and not older than 65.</li>
                    <li>Weight: Weigh at least 45 kg (or meet the specific weight requirement of the blood bank).</li>
                    <li>General Health: Be in good general health and not suffer from any major illnesses or transmittable diseases.</li>
                    <li>Vitals: Have normal blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature. </li>
                    <li>Hemoglobin: Meet the required hemoglobin level, which is checked with a finger prick. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Blood Donation Process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Registration: You will need to provide your details. </li>
                    <li>Mini-Physical: A staff member will check your blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and hemoglobin levels to ensure it's safe for you to donate. </li>
                    <li>Donation: A sterile needle is used to collect approximately one unit of blood, which takes about 8-10 minutes for a whole blood donation. </li>
                    <li>Refreshments: After the donation, you will receive refreshments. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why Donate Blood?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saves Lives: Donated blood can be separated into its components (red cells, plasma, and platelets) and used to help multiple patients.</li>
                    <li>No Substitute: Blood cannot be manufactured artificially; it must come from human donors. </li>
                    <li>Safe and Rewarding: The process is safe, sterile, and can be a rewarding experience. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
